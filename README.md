# QML Class Spring 2024 - Quantum Classifier Project

## Project Overview
 
This project involves simulating a quantum classifier using a variational quantum circuit for binary classification problems. It is divided into three main parts, each contributing to the total project credits.

## Part 1: Quantum Classifier for 3-input Parity Problem (6/10 Credits)

### Requirements:
- **Objective:** Build a quantum classifier for the binary classification parity problem with 3 inputs.
- **Data:** Provided train and test datasets (`classA_train.dat`, `classB_train.dat`, `classA_test.dat`, `classB_test.dat`).
- **Data Preprocessing:** Allowed to shift the data or perform simple preprocessing like subtracting 0.5 from all data.

### Deliverables:
1. **Circuit Design:** Design the quantum circuit including measurements (recommendation: do not exceed 4 qubits).
2. **Cost Function:** Define the cost function using the expectation value of measurements at the end of the circuit.
3. **Optimization Method:** Select and describe the optimization method used.
4. **Classification Outcomes:** Report the accuracy and other relevant metrics for train and test data.
5. **Program Code:** Provide the Python code used for the simulation.

## Part 2: Extended Research (2/10 Credits)

### Topics (choose one):
- Compare different classical optimization methods and/or loss functions.
- Justify the model using geometric representations like the Bloch sphere.
- Compare parameters, epochs, and structure with a classical neural network solving the same problem.
- Implement the parameter-shift rule for gradient evaluation.
- Apply the classifier to another binary classification problem with 3 inputs and report the outcomes.
- Any other interesting subject related to quantum machine learning (consultation with the instructor recommended).

## Part 3: Extended Model for 5-input Parity Problem (2/10 Credits)

### Requirements:
- **Objective:** Extend the quantum classifier model to handle the parity problem with 5 inputs.
- **Data:** Provided datasets (`classA_train_N5.dat`, `classB_train_N5.dat`, `classA_test_N5.dat`, `classB_test_N5.dat`).
